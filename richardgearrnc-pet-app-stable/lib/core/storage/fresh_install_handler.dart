/// Handles fresh install detection and secure storage cleanup.
///
/// On iOS, Keychain data (used by flutter_secure_storage) persists even after
/// the app is uninstalled. This can cause issues where:
/// - User uninstalls app while logged in
/// - User reinstalls app
/// - App shows onboarding (SharedPreferences cleared)
/// - But user appears logged in (Keychain tokens survived)
///
/// This handler detects fresh installs by checking a marker in SharedPreferences.
/// If the marker is missing (fresh install/reinstall), it clears secure storage
/// to ensure a clean state.
///
/// **Usage:**
/// Call [handleFreshInstall] during app initialization, before any auth checks.
///
/// ```dart
/// await FreshInstallHandler.handleFreshInstall(
///   prefs: sharedPreferences,
///   secureStorage: secureStorage,
/// );
/// ```
